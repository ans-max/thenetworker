AWS is a leading cloud infrastructure platform that offers a wide range of services for SaaS, PaaS, and other aaS solutions. As one of the first cloud providers, Amazon has had the time and resources to develop a comprehensive set of services that can meet the needs of individual developers and businesses of all sizes.

For someone with experience in IT infrastructure, such as managing networks and servers, the AWS Solutions Architect certification is a great introduction to AWS cloud services and their use cases. I passed my exam on Jun 23 2023, and below are the resources and methods i followed to achieve the same, 

The [AWS Solutions Architect Exam](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/) is senario based exam where engineer is ask select a solution that best fits a given problem statements, the options are sometimes in form of multiple choice,

The details of how the exam is evaluated can be looked up [here](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/policies/after-testing/)

It took me around 4 months to properly prepare for the exam, and below are steps i took to prepare the exam 

Courses used:

 [Stéphane Maarek's Solution Architect Course](https://www.udemy.com/share/106WtA3@HxoUAqPPlIew_W5F6YFFtBv2QZC0SP00lkRZR6FmAXz_wygBQeWDBvBI7kJrD5o=/)

 [AWS Solutions Architect Associate Practise Exams](https://www.udemy.com/share/102Yz63@33KT6ou0uF8HC9emiKZnFsI0a0AuJ-wCzP8kV3fPK-kOwtSUofGal33oTfvK3s0=/)

1) Getting  an AWS account, I found that the free tier had almost every thing required for practicing the services, I just made sure that i  clean up the services after practice so that i dont get charged accidently, most online courses have some practise sessions and handson labs, I found it usefull to follow the labs and get the feel of the infrasturcture  

2) Scheduled an Exam date and literally booked the exam, this kept me on track with the goal, though i had to reschedule it a lot due to health issues, i was still able to keep my study going since i had  

3) I followed the Udemy course by Stéphane Maarek which can be access from [here](https://www.udemy.com/share/106WtA3@HxoUAqPPlIew_W5F6YFFtBv2QZC0SP00lkRZR6FmAXz_wygBQeWDBvBI7kJrD5o=/), there are other recommended courses as well, I selected Stéphane Maarek's course since being a software developer,he gave a detailed overview of the services like Kinesis, DynamoDB, ect in a very simple and understandable way, coming from a networking back ground I was able to grasp the networking concepts, however concpets of msg queues and Databases were alien to me, Stéphane's Teaching style helped me to understand them as well 

4) After covering a topic/service in the course videos i would check out the [aws documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/) for said service, instead of going to very detail I would just skimm through the first page to understand what the service is being used for and its common use cases this helped in solidify the concepts from the videos 

5) AWS has a concept of [well architected framework](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/welcome.html) that outlines, what a prescirbed architectural solution should follow in principles, from a simple document it has now evolved into an application that can be used to validate any currently running infrastructure on aws, I went through the framework documentation to understand the underlying principles 

6) Once completed above, I, with full of confidence started with practice exams and was knocked back to earth with mere 54% on first attempt, that too in the exam that came with the video course :(, So i reviewed all my answers and read the explainations provided in the solutions, this made me realise that even though i know the how the aws services work, I still need to practise as many problems i can to understand there specific usecases and differences, the solutions also highlighted my poor understanding of few services forcing me to go back to course videos and aws documentation 

7) To practise more I took practise test availale in udemy which can be found [here](https://www.udemy.com/share/102Yz63@33KT6ou0uF8HC9emiKZnFsI0a0AuJ-wCzP8kV3fPK-kOwtSUofGal33oTfvK3s0=/), these practise tests were good enough to clear any confusions about the aws services and how to use them to build solutions that follow the aws principals of well architechited framework

8) AWS also publishes architecture diagrams and whitepapers about its services, I found they are really good tools to understand how all aws services sit together to solve infrastructure challanges, A few youtube videos too explained certain concepts a very clear way, 

An that was it, though one more thing, I know the exam has a cost, but please schedule the exam if ya plan to take it, Otherwise as it normally happens we tend put of the hardwork to a later date, scheduling the exam helped me keep on track with my study schedule, and we can reschedule the exam incase we feel we want to

Some times smaller goal posts like an exam date help us guide through an otherwise difficult to walk path
